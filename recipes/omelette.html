    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The classic omelette is a masterpiece of simplicity, transforming humble
      eggs into a sophisticated, protein-packed meal in minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients Requirements:-</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 or 3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>A pinch of kosher salt</li>
      <li>
        A pinch of freshly ground black pepper (white pepper is traditional for
        a clean look)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh chives, finely chopped (optional garnish)</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons shredded cheese, such as Gruyère or Cheddar (optional
        filling)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, crack the eggs and whisk them vigorously with a fork
        until no streaks of white remain. Season with a pinch of salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat and add the butter. Let
        it melt until it starts to foam but doesn't brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Using a heat-resistant spatula,
        gently move the eggs around to create small curds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, use the
        spatula to smoothen them into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>If using cheese, sprinkle it across the center of the eggs now.</li>
      <li>
        Carefully fold one-third of the omelette over the center, then slide it
        onto a plate, folding it again so it lands seam-side down.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh chives and serve immediately while hot.</li>
    </ol>
