    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There is nothing quite like a batch of perfectly golden, double-fried
      French fries.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fries feature a remarkably crunchy exterior that shatters upon
      impact, revealing a fluffy, cloud-like potato interior that is seasoned to
      perfection with just a touch of sea salt.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients Requirements:-</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large Russet potatoes (best for starch content)</li>
      <li>2 quarts vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
      <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
      <li>Optional: Freshly cracked black pepper or paprika</li>
      <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon white vinegar (for the soaking water)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel the potatoes (optional) and cut them into even sticks about 1/4 to
        1/2 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak
        for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with a clean kitchen
        towel or paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 325°F (160°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches, fry the potatoes for about 3-5 minutes until they
        are soft but not yet browned. Remove them and let them drain on paper
        towels.
      </li>
      <li>Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        Fry the potatoes a second time for 2-3 minutes until they are golden
        brown and perfectly crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oil, immediately toss with sea salt in a large bowl, and
        serve hot!
      </li>
    </ol>
